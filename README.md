## Features
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Supports only [VSCode-style snippets (JSON files)](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vscode).
- Add new snippets, edit snippets, delete snippets.
- Automagical conversion from buffer text to JSON string (quotes are escaped, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting while you edit the snippet. Includes highlighting of
  tabstop tokens like `$0` or `${2:foobar}`.
- Auto-reloading of the new snippet (if using `LuaSnip`).
- JSON-formatting and sorting of the snippet file after updating, using `yq` or
  `jq` (Optional, but useful when version-controlling your snippet collection.)

> [!NOTE]
> This plugin only *manages* snippets. It does not provide a snippet *engine*
> and therefore does not expand snippets. Install a plugin like
> [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip) for that.

## Rationale
- Regrettably, there are innumerable formats in which snippets can be saved. The
  only format which supported by many applications and somewhat comes close to
  being a standard is the [VSCode snippet
  format](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets). For
  portability and to future-proof your snippet collection, it thus makes sense to
  save your snippets in that format.
- Most notably, the VSCode snippet format is used by plugins like
  [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) and also
  supported by [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip).
- However, the snippets are stored in JSON files, which are a pain to modify
  manually. This plugin aims to alleviate that pain by automagically writing
  the JSON for you.

> [!TIP]
> You can use
> [snippet-converter.nvim](https://github.com/smjonas/snippet-converter.nvim) to
> convert your snippets to different formats.

## Installation

```lua
-- lazy.nvim
{
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	opts = {
		snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
	} 
},

-- packer
use {
	"chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
	config = function()
		require("nvim-scissors").setup ({
			snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
		})
	end,
}
```

## Usage
The plugin provides two commands, `addNewSnippet` and `editSnippet`. Here is the
code to create keymaps for them:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(
	"n",
	"<leader>se",
	function() require("scissors").editSnippet() end,
	{ desc = "ÔÉÑ Edit Snippets" }
)
vim.keymap.set(
	"n",
	"<leader>sa",
	function() require("scissors").addNewSnippet() end,
	{ desc = "ÔÉÑ Add new snippet" }
)
```

## Configuration

The `.setup()` call is optional.

```lua
-- default settings
require("nvim-scissors").setup {
	snippetDir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/snippets",
	editSnippetPopup = {
		height = 0.4, -- between 0-1
		width = 0.6,
		border = "rounded",
		keymaps = {
			cancel = "q",
			saveChanges = "<CR>", -- normal mode
			delete = "<C-BS>",
			openInFile = "<C-o>",
		},
	},
	-- `none` writes as a minified json file using `:h vim.encode.json`.
	-- `yq` and `jq` ensure formatted & sorted json files, which is relevant when
	-- you are version control your snippets.
	jsonFormatter = "none", -- "yq"|"jq"|"none"

	-- on adding/editing a snippet, reload the snippet file. Currently only
	-- supports LuaSnip (PRs welcome)
	autoReload = true,
}
```

> [!TIP]
> `vim.fn.stdpath("config")` returns the path to your nvim config, so you do not
> need to the location of your snippet folder.

## Note on JSON-formatting
This plugin writes JSON files via `vim.encode.json`. This method always writes
the file in minified form, and also does not have a deterministic order of
dictionary keys. That means that the JSON file can have a different order of
keys before and after updating it via `nvim-scissors`.

Both, minification, and unstable key order are of course problem if you version-control
your snippet collection. To solve this problem, `nvim-scissors` can optionally
unminify and sort the JSON files after updating it via `yq` or `jq`. (Both are
also available via [mason.nvim](https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim).)

It is recommended to run `yq`/`jq` once on all files in your snippet
collection, since the first time you edit a file, you still get a large diff
from the initial sorting. You can do so with `yq` with this command:

```bash
cd "/your/snippet/dir"
fd ".*\.json" | xargs -I {} yq --inplace --output-format=json "sort_keys(..)" {}
```

(How to do the same with `jq` is left as an exercise to the reader. üôÇ)
