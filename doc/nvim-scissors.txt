FEATURES                               *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--features*

- Add new snippets, edit snippets, or delete snippets on the fly.
- Syntax highlighting while you edit the snippet. Includes highlighting of
    tabstops and placeholders such as `$0`, `${2:foobar}`, or `$CLIPBOARD`
- Automagical conversion from buffer text to JSON string.
- Intuitive UI for editing the snippet, dynamically adapting the number of
    prefixes.
- Automatic hot-reloading of any changes.
- Optional JSON-formatting and sorting of the snippet file after updating, using
    `yq` or `jq`. (|nvim-scissors-useful-when-version-controlling-your-snippet-collection|.)
- Snippet/file selection via `telescope` or `vim.ui.select`.
- Automatic bootstrapping of the snippet folder or new snippet files if needed.
- Supports only VSCode-style
    snippets <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets>.


  [!TIP] You can use snippet-converter.nvim
  <https://github.com/smjonas/snippet-converter.nvim> to convert your snippets to
  the VSCode format.

RATIONALE                             *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--rationale*

- The VSCode snippet
    format <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets> is the
    closest thing to a standard regarding snippets. It is used by
    friendly-snippets <https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets> and
    supported by most snippet engine plugins for nvim.
- However, the snippets are stored as JSON files, which are a pain to modify
    manually. This plugin aims to alleviate that pain by automagically writing the
    JSON for you.


REQUIREMENTS                       *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--requirements*

- nvim 0.10+
- Snippets saved in the |nvim-scissors-vscode-style-snippet-format|.
- telescope <https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim> OR
    (dressing.nvim <http://github.com/stevearc/dressing.nvim> AND
    fzf-lua <https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua>).
    - Note that snippet previews
        only work when using `telescope`.
- A snippet engine that can load VSCode-style snippets, such as:
    - LuaSnip <https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip>
    - blink.cmp <http://support.blinkforhome.com/en_US/account-and-login>
    - basics-language-server <https://github.com/antonk52/basics-language-server/>
    - nvim-snippets <https://github.com/garymjr/nvim-snippets>
    - vim-vsnip <https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip>
- _Optional_Treesitter parsers for the languages you want syntax highlighting
    for.


INSTALLATION                       *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--installation*


NVIM-SCISSORS ~

>lua
    -- lazy.nvim
    {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
        dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", 
        opts = {
            snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
        } 
    },
    
    -- packer
    use {
        "chrisgrieser/nvim-scissors",
        dependencies = "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", 
        config = function()
            require("scissors").setup ({
                snippetDir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder",
            })
        end,
    }
<


SNIPPET ENGINE SETUP ~

In addition, your snippet engine needs to point to the same snippet folder as
`nvim-scissors`


  [!TIP] `vim.fn.stdpath("config")`returns the path to your nvim config.

LUASNIP

>lua
    require("luasnip.loaders.from_vscode").lazy_load {
        paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
    }
<


BLINK.CMP

>lua
    require("blink.cmp").setup {
        sources = {
            providers = {
                snippets = {
                    opts = {
                        search_paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    }
<


BASICS-LANGUAGE-SERVER

>lua
    -- NOTE: this requires the `nvim-lspconfig` as additional dependency
    require('lspconfig').basics_ls.setup({
        settings = {
            snippet = {
                enable = true,
                sources = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" }
            },
        }
    })
<

Hot-reloading of the new/edited snippet for `basics_ls` requires
`nvim-lspconfig`.


NVIM-SNIPPETS

>lua
    require("nvim-snippets").setup {
        search_paths = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" },
    }
<


VIM-VSNIP

>lua
    vim.g.vsnip_snippet_dir = "path/to/your/snippetFolder"
    -- OR
    vim.g.vsnip_snippet_dirs = { "path/to/your/snippetFolder" }
<


USAGE                                     *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--usage*


MAIN USAGE ~

The plugin provides two ex commands, `:ScissorsAddNewSnippet` and
`:ScissorsEditSnippet`. You can pass a range to `:ScissorsAddSnippet` command
to prefill snippet body (for example `:'<,'> ScissorsAddSnippet` or `:3
ScissorsAddSnippet`).

The plugin also provides two lua functions `addNewSnippet` and `editSnippet`,
which you can use to directly create keymaps:

>lua
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>se", function() require("scissors").editSnippet() end)
    
    -- when used in visual mode, prefills the selection as snippet body
    vim.keymap.set({ "n", "x" }, "<leader>sa", function() require("scissors").addNewSnippet() end)
<


PREFIXES ~

"Prefix" is how trigger words are referred to in the VSCode format.

The popup intelligently adapts to changes in the prefix area: Each line
represents one prefix, and creating or removing lines thus changes the number
of prefixes.




CONFIGURATION                     *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--configuration*

The `.setup()` call is optional.

>lua
    -- default settings
    require("scissors").setup {
        snippetDir = vim.fn.stdpath("config") .. "/snippets",
        editSnippetPopup = {
            height = 0.4, -- relative to the window, between 0-1
            width = 0.6,
            border = "rounded",
            keymaps = {
                cancel = "q",
                saveChanges = "<CR>", -- alternatively, can also use `:w`
                goBackToSearch = "<BS>",
                deleteSnippet = "<C-BS>",
                duplicateSnippet = "<C-d>",
                openInFile = "<C-o>",
                insertNextPlaceholder = "<C-p>", -- insert & normal mode
            },
        },
        telescope = {
            -- By default, the query only searches snippet prefixes. Set this to
            -- `true` to also search the body of the snippets.
            alsoSearchSnippetBody = false,
        },
        -- `none` writes as a minified json file using `vim.encode.json`.
        -- `yq`/`jq` ensure formatted & sorted json files, which is relevant when
        -- you version control your snippets. To use a custom formatter, set to a
        -- list of strings, which will then be passed to `vim.system()`.
        ---@type "yq"|"jq"|"none"|string[]
        jsonFormatter = "none",
    
        backdrop = {
            enabled = true,
            blend = 50, -- between 0-100
        },
        icons = {
            scissors = "󰩫",
        },
    }

COOKBOOK & FAQ                   *nvim-scissors-nvim-scissors--cookbook-&-faq*


INTRODUCTION TO THE VSCODE-STYLE SNIPPET FORMAT ~

This plugin requires that you have a valid VSCode snippet folder. In addition
to saving the snippets in the required JSON format, there must also be a
`package.json` file at the root of the snippet folder, specifying which files
should be used for which languages.

Example file structure inside the `snippetDir`

>txt
    .
    ├── package.json
    ├── python.json
    ├── project-specific
    │   └── nvim-lua.json
    ├── javascript.json
    └── allFiletypes.json
<

Example`package.json`

>json
    {
        "contributes": {
            "snippets": [
                {
                    "language": "python",
                    "path": "./python.json"
                },
                {
                    "language": "lua",
                    "path": "./project-specific/nvim-lua.json"
                },
                {
                    "language": ["javascript", "typescript"],
                    "path": "./javascript.json"
                },
                {
                    "language": "all",
                    "path": "./allFiletypes.json"
                }
            ]
        },
        "name": "my-snippets"
    }
<


  [!NOTE] Thespecial filetype `all` enables the snippets globally, regardless of
  filetype.
Example snippet file (here: `nvim-lua.json`):

>json
    {
      "autocmd (Filetype)": {
        "body": [
          "vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"FileType\", {",
          "\tpattern = \"${1:ft}\",",
          "\tcallback = function()",
          "\t\t$0",
          "\tend,",
          "})"
        ],
        "prefix": "autocmd (Filetype)"
      },
      "file exists": {
        "body": "local fileExists = vim.uv.fs_stat(\"${1:filepath}\") ~= nil",
        "prefix": "file exists"
      },
    }
<

For details, read the official VSCode snippet documentation: - Snippet file
specification <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets> -
`package.json` specification
<https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/snippet-guide> -
LuaSnip-specific additions to the format
<https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code>


VARIABLES & TABSTOPS ~

Tabstops
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_tabstops> are
denoted by `$1`, `$2`, `$3`, with `$0` being the last tabstop. They support
placeholders such `${1:foobar}`.


  [!NOTE] Due to the use of `$` in the snippet syntax, any _literal_ `$` needs to
  be escaped as `\$`.
Furthermore, there are various variables you can use, such as `$TM_FILENAME` or
`$LINE_COMMENT`. See here for a full list of variables
<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables>.


  [!TIP] If you frequently create new snippets, you may also use the command
  `:ScissorsCreateSnippetsForSnippetVars` to create snippets for the VSCode
  snippet variables in the `nvim-scissors` popup window. For example, typing
  `filen` then triggers a suggestion for `$TM_FILENAME`.

FRIENDLY-SNIPPETS ~

Even though the snippets from the friendly-snippets
<https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets> repository are written in the
VSCode-style format, editing them directly is not supported. The reason being
that any changes made would be overwritten as soon as the `friendly-snippets`
repository is updated (which happens fairly regularly). Unfortunately, there is
little `nvim-scissors` can do about that.

What you can do, however, is to copy individual snippets files from the
`friendly-snippets` repository into your own snippet folder, and edit them
there.


EDIT SNIPPET TITLE AND SNIPPET DESCRIPTION ~

`nvim-scissors` only allows to edit the snippet prefix and snippet body, to
keep the UI as simple as possible. For the few cases where you need to edit a
snippet’s title or description, you can use the `openInFile` keymap and edit
them directly in the snippet file.


VERSION CONTROLLING SNIPPETS: JSON-FORMATTING ~

This plugin writes JSON files via `vim.encode.json()`. That method saves the
file in minified form, and does not have a deterministic order of dictionary
keys.

Both, minification and unstable key order, are a problem if you version-control
your snippet collection. To solve this issue, `nvim-scissors` can optionally
unminify and sort the JSON files via `yq` or `jq` after updating a snippet.
(Both are also available via mason.nvim
<https://github.com/williamboman/mason.nvim>.)

It is recommended to run `yq`/`jq` once on all files in your snippet
collection, since the first time you edit a file, you would still get a large
diff from the initial sorting. You can do so with `yq` using this command:

>bash
    cd "/your/snippet/dir"
    fd ".*\.json" | xargs -I {} yq --inplace --output-format=json "sort_keys(..)" {}
<

How to do the same with `jq` is left as an exercise to the reader.


SNIPPETS ON VISUAL SELECTIONS ~

With `Luasnip`, this is an opt-in feature, enabled via:

>lua
    require("luasnip").setup {
        store_selection_keys = "<Tab>",
    }
<

In your VSCode-style snippet, use the token `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` at the location
where you want the selection to be inserted. (It’s roughly the equivalent of
`LS_SELECT_RAW` in the `Luasnip` syntax.)

Then, in visual mode, press the key from `store_selection_keys`. The selection
disappears, and you are put in insert mode. The next snippet you now trigger is
going to have `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` replaced with your selection.


AUTO-TRIGGERED SNIPPETS ~

While the VSCode snippet format does not support auto-triggered snippets,
`LuaSnip` allows you to specify auto-triggering in the VSCode-style JSON files
by adding the `luasnip` key
<https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/master/DOC.md#vs-code>.

`nvim-scissors` does not touch any keys other than `prefix` and `body` in the
JSON files, so any additions via the `luasnip` key are preserved.


  [!TIP] You can use the `openInFile` keymap to directory open JSON file at the
  snippet’s location to make edits there easier.
